# AI Credit Dispute Letter Generator — Static MVP

This repository contains a small, static, front-end MVP for an AI-powered self-service credit dispute letter generator (NOT a credit repair service). The site is a static landing page plus a client-side intake form that generates a sample dispute letter.

What this project includes
- `index.html` — professional fintech-style landing page, intake form, and letter preview
- `styles.css` — responsive, accessible styles (blue/white palette)
- `app.js` — vanilla JavaScript that handles form submission and generates a sample letter preview

How to run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build tools required).

How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this project to the repository root.
2. In the repository settings, go to "Pages" and select the `main` (or `master`) branch and the root folder as the publishing source.
3. Save and wait a minute — your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Notes & roadmap
- This is a front-end only demo. Payments, real AI model integration, secure storage, and mailing features are planned but not implemented.
- The product is positioned as self-service software and credit education, not a credit repair service.
- Legal: The site includes an FCRA reference and explicit disclaimers. Do not represent outcomes as guaranteed.

Future work
- Integrate a secure AI backend for letter drafting and personalization
- Add secure payment processing and subscription management
- Add PDF export and mailing/integration options
- Add audit logs, privacy policy, and stronger consent flows
